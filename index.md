## Welcome to Just N Numbers

The FAA N number allocation system is broken. Many times the N number you want is taken by "N number trolls" who demand exhorbitant fees to make a quick buck. We want to fix it. 

Our goal is to make the economics of getting the N number you want fair and just. Let's cut out all the noise, and deliver just N numbers...
